# Prism for Xamarin.Forms

You can use this repository as a step by step guide to show some of the most important features of Prism for Xamarin.Forms. It has a separate commit for each feature, allowing you to easily show the diff between 2 steps and if necessary pick up on the next step (yes, demo gods ...).

*Credits to Brian Lagunas for most of the work on the Xamarin.Forms part of Prism and the initial demo on which this is based.*
