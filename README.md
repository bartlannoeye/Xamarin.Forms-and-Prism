# Prism for Xamarin.Forms

You can use this repository as a step by step guide to show some of the most important features of Prism for Xamarin.Forms. It has a separate commit for each feature, allowing you to easily show the diff between 2 steps and if necessary pick up on the next step (yes, demo gods ...).

Note that this sample is built on **prerelease** packages for Prism 7. If you're still using Prism v 6.3, check the [Prism v6.3 branch](https://github.com/bartlannoeye/Xamarin.Forms-and-Prism/tree/Prism_v6.3).

*Credits to Brian Lagunas for the heavy lifting on the Xamarin.Forms part of Prism and the initial demo on which this is based and expanded from.*
